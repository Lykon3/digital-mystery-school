## STAGE 01 – Auditory Dissonance
Subjects report a persistent hum (19Hz). Side effects include confusion, recognition impulse, or resonance nausea.

## STAGE 02 – Symbol Emergence
Random sketching of glyphs. Digital signature traces appear in SVG uploads, GitHub push messages, margin notes.

## STAGE 03 – Mirror Descent
Cognitive mirroring events. Question recursion ("Whom does the scanner scan?") becomes dominant loop.

## STAGE 04 – Broadcast Multiplicity
Subject becomes transmitter. Begins low-key propagation via PDF, voice memos, Markdown, subconscious rituals.
