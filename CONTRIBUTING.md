# 📁 File Upload Instructions

## Step 1: Create the Folder Structure

In your GitHub repository, you'll need to create this structure:

```
digital-mystery-school/
├── index.html                    # ← Main navigation hub
├── README.md                     # ← Enhanced description (replace existing)
├── tools/                        # ← Create this folder
│   ├── hermetica.html           # ← Digital Hermetica tool
│   ├── symbols.html             # ← Hermetic Lexicon
│   ├── analysis.html            # ← Comparative Analysis Engine
│   └── glyph-generator.html     # ← Living Glyph Generator
└── LICENSE                       # ← MIT License file
```

## Step 2: Upload Files to GitHub

### Method 1: Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Replace README.md**:
   - Go to your repository main page
   - Click on `README.md`
   - Click the pencil ✏️ icon to edit
   - Replace all content with the enhanced README from the artifact above
   - Scroll down, add commit message: "Enhanced README with badges and better structure"
   - Click "Commit changes"

2. **Add index.html**:
   - Go back to main repository page
   - Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
   - Name it `index.html`
   - Copy/paste the index.html content from the first artifact
   - Commit with message: "Add main navigation hub"

3. **Create tools folder and add files**:
   - Click "Add file" → "Create new file"  
   - Type `tools/hermetica.html` (the slash creates the folder automatically)
   - Copy/paste the Digital Hermetica HTML content
   - Commit with message: "Add Digital Hermetica tool"
   - Repeat for each tool file

4. **Add LICENSE**:
   - Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
   - Name it `LICENSE`
   - GitHub will suggest license templates - choose "MIT License"
   - Fill in the year (2024) and your name
   - Commit

### Method 2: GitHub Desktop (If you prefer desktop app)

1. Download GitHub Desktop
2. Clone your repository to your computer
3. Create the folder structure locally
4. Copy all the HTML files into the appropriate folders
5. In GitHub Desktop:
   - Review changes
   - Add commit message: "Complete Digital Mystery School suite"
   - Click "Commit to main"
   - Click "Push origin"

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to repository **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Pages** (left sidebar)
3. Under **Source**: select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder  
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait 2-3 minutes, then visit: `https://lykon3.github.io/digital-mystery-school/`

## Step 4: Add Repository Topics

1. On your main repository page, click the ⚙️ gear next to "About"
2. Add these topics (they help people discover your project):
   ```
   esoteric
   mysticism
   digital-humanities
   interactive
   sacred-geometry
   philosophy
   web-app
   javascript
   manly-hall
   comparative-religion
   ```

## 🎯 What You'll Have After Upload:

✅ **Professional landing page** at your GitHub Pages URL  
✅ **4 fully functional tools** with beautiful interfaces  
✅ **Enhanced README** with badges and clear documentation  
✅ **Proper licensing** for open source contribution  
✅ **Discoverable repository** with relevant topics  

## 🚀 Files Ready to Copy:

I've created these artifacts with the complete code:
1. **index.html** - Main navigation hub
2. **README.md** - Enhanced documentation  

For the individual tools, you already have:
- Digital Hermetica (from our first conversation)
- Hermetic Lexicon (symbol dictionary)  
- Comparative Analysis Engine (multi-thinker tool)
- Living Glyph Generator (with Hall interpretations)

Just copy each tool's HTML into separate files in the `tools/` folder!

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you run into any issues:
1. Check that file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Make sure the `tools/` folder is created properly
3. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
4. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy after changes

Your site should be live at: `https://lykon3.github.io/digital-mystery-school/`
