## 💻 Developers & Technical Community

### Alexandra Petrov - Full-Stack Developer
> *"As a developer interested in digital preservation of cultural knowledge, I'm impressed by both the technical execution and the content quality.

But what really stands out is how technology serves the content rather than overshadowing it. This is how digital humanities projects should be done."*

**Specialty**: Cultural heritage digitization projects  
**GitHub**: @alexcodes4culture

### Robert Chen - UX Designer
> *"The user experience design is masterful. Every interaction feels intentional and respectful of the sacred content.

**Company**: Design lead at cultural institutions  
**Focus**: Accessible design for educational content

## 📚 Researchers & Content Contributors

### Dr. Michael Hassan - Historian of Esotericism
> *"The scholarly approach to presenting Manly P. Hall's work is commendable. Too often, esoteric content is presented without proper historical context.

**Institution**: Institute for the Study of Western Esotericism, University of Amsterdam

**Institution**: Metropolitan Museum of Art, Research Department

**Translation**: "As a philosophy student, I found the translation of esoteric concepts very accessible."  
**Institution**: Sorbonne University, Paris

### Akiko Tanaka - Digital Artist (Japan)
