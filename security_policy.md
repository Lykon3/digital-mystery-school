## 🔮 Philosophy on Security

*"In the pursuit of ancient wisdom, we must guard against modern threats. Just as the mystery schools of old protected their sacred knowledge from those who would misuse it, we protect our digital sanctuary from those who would do harm."*

**Remember**: The greatest security vulnerability is often human error. Please help us maintain a secure environment for all seekers by reporting any suspicious activity or potential security concerns.
