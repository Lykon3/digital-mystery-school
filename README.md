# ✨ Digital Mystery School

Welcome to the **Digital Mystery School** — an open-source sanctuary for modern mystics, esoteric technologists, and symbolic explorers. This interactive archive blends ancient wisdom with digital tools, inviting you to engage with the Hermetic, the mythic, and the unknown through your browser.

---

## 🧭 Project Vision

The Digital Mystery School is a creative and philosophical engine for:
- Designing rituals
- Generating symbolic glyphs
- Exploring Hermetic and comparative philosophy
- Building an open-source codex of archetypal tools

This space bridges the ancient and the electric — a constellation of interfaces for self-initiation, creative experimentation, and open esotericism.

## Overview

This repository contains cutting-edge research into plasma physics applications, with a particular focus on disruption prediction and stability analysis in tokamak fusion devices. The work encompasses both theoretical frameworks and practical implementation strategies for next-generation fusion reactors like ITER and SPARC.

## 🔬 Core Research Areas

### Tension-Collapse Topology (TCT) Model
A novel physics-based framework for predicting tokamak disruptions through coupled field equations modeling instability propagation and cascade failures.

### Information Catastrophe Thermodynamics (ICT)
Theoretical framework treating information as a dynamic substrate with topological and thermodynamic properties, enabling prediction of computational collapse events.

### Hybrid Physics-ML Approaches
Integration of physics-informed models with machine learning for enhanced disruption prediction capabilities.

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (for ML components)
- Additional dependencies in `requirements.txt`

### Basic Usage
```python
from models.tct_model import TensionCollapseTopology
from analysis.disruption_prediction import DisruptionPredictor

# Initialize TCT model
tct = TensionCollapseTopology(grid_size=(100, 100))

# Run simulation
results = tct.simulate(time_steps=200)

# Analyze early warning signals
predictor = DisruptionPredictor()
warning_signals = predictor.analyze_precursors(results)
```

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Early Warning Detection**: Statistical precursors provide 50-100 timesteps advance warning
- **Universal Patterns**: Consistent signatures across different disruption pathways
- **Real-time Capability**: Computationally efficient for operational implementation
- **Cross-domain Applications**: Framework extends beyond fusion to other complex systems

## 🧪 Experimental Validation

The models generate testable predictions for:
- Statistical precursors in tokamak disruption data
- Critical transition signatures in plasma fluctuations
- Warning timeframe scaling with operational parameters
