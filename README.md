## Overview

This repository contains cutting-edge research into plasma physics applications, with a particular focus on disruption prediction and stability analysis in tokamak fusion devices. The work encompasses both theoretical frameworks and practical implementation strategies for next-generation fusion reactors like ITER and SPARC.

## 🔬 Core Research Areas

### Tension-Collapse Topology (TCT) Model
A novel physics-based framework for predicting tokamak disruptions through coupled field equations modeling instability propagation and cascade failures.

### Information Catastrophe Thermodynamics (ICT)
Theoretical framework treating information as a dynamic substrate with topological and thermodynamic properties, enabling prediction of computational collapse events.

### Hybrid Physics-ML Approaches
Integration of physics-informed models with machine learning for enhanced disruption prediction capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (for ML components)
- Additional dependencies in `requirements.txt`

### Basic Usage
```python
from models.tct_model import TensionCollapseTopology
from analysis.disruption_prediction import DisruptionPredictor

# Initialize TCT model
tct = TensionCollapseTopology(grid_size=(100, 100))

# Run simulation
results = tct.simulate(time_steps=200)

# Analyze early warning signals
predictor = DisruptionPredictor()
warning_signals = predictor.analyze_precursors(results)
```
